"""Development Environment Specific Settings"""
# This file is generally NOT used if you follow the class-based
# configuration approach in app/core/config.py.
# The DevelopmentConfig class there holds these settings.

# If you were using a simpler config loading mechanism, you might put:
# DEBUG = True
# SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'mysql+mysqlconnector://user:password@localhost/smartgig_dev'
# SQLALCHEMY_ECHO = True

# However, with the current setup, this file is likely redundant.
