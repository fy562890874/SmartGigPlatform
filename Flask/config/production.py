"""Production Environment Specific Settings"""
# This file is generally NOT used if you follow the class-based
# configuration approach in app/core/config.py.
# The ProductionConfig class there holds these settings,
# ideally loaded from environment variables.

# If you were using a simpler config loading mechanism, you might put:
# DEBUG = False
# # SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI would be loaded from environment variables
# # SECRET_KEY would be loaded from environment variables

# However, with the current setup, this file is likely redundant.
