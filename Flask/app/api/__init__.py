"""API Blueprint Aggregator"""
# This file can be used to aggregate blueprints from different API versions or modules.
# For now, v1 is handled in app.api.v1.v1_blueprint

# Example if you had multiple version blueprints:
# from .v1 import v1_blueprint
# from .v2 import v2_blueprint # if v2 exists

# all_api_blueprints = [v1_blueprint, v2_blueprint]
